 ### Description
 A simple chat, where users can talk to each other privatly, or use "rooms" which are like public chats, where all the logged in users can communicate with other users, there are rooms about crypto, general, tech & finance.


### Technologies

To host my web app I've used Render.com, and if you visit, it might take a bit of time to load the api's
