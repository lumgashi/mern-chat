# mern-iChat
 
 ### Description
 A simple real time chat, where users can talk to each other privatly, or use "rooms" which are like public chats, where all the logged in users can communicate with other users, there are rooms about crypto, general, tech & finance, all of this in real time.


### Technologies
To build this web app, I've used MERN Stack, meaning on the frontend, React, React Hooks, React Redux Toolkit, Socket.io, and on the backend Node.js & Socket.io, and Mongodb as the database.

### Url
To host my web app I've used Render.com, and if you visit, it might take a bit of time to load the api's
